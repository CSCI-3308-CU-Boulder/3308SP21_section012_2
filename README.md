Project Description: 
The SpotiTRY project uses the Spotify API to access user’s information including top songs, top artists, and browsing history via tokens authenticated by the user upon login. The user logins into there Spotify account to access our application and the SpotiTRY application comes fully equipped with routing guards that protects our users. The users’ top songs and artists are displayed on our home page allowing the user to comfortable view not only their favorite songs but also their favorite artists.  Our History page is feature that was adapted by Spotify during the time we were developing SpotiTRY and is similar in the respect that it allows the user to view recent song or listening history in an interesting manner that includes a search bar so the user can quickly find that great song they were just listening to. Our Timestamp feature, however, is in fact wholly unique to the SpotiTRY application. If a user has a point in a song or podcast and wishes to save that point SpotiTRY has the Timestamp feature. The Timestamp feature allows the user to play a song or podcast within our application and find the point at which they wish to save and save said point in our database.
