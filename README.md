Project Description: 
As part of our project we plan to be using Spotify’s API to be able to gather data on a user’s listening preferences. This means that we are able to gather all metadata from songs, playlists, albums, as well as different artists and genres. Our main goal with this project is to be able to use this data to be able to display it to the user to show them all the different aspects of music that they may like to be able to share it to someone else or use that to be able to find new music to expand their library. To do this, we used Spotify;s Web API to be able to gather all the data. To do this we plan to be able to externally log into the Spotify Web App able to be able to use the Web API to be able to request all information from songs, playlists, etc. to display the Spotify User/Category IDs to the user using our Spotify project.

Application Architecture: 
We will be using the React framework for Javascript and we will use the SpotifyAPI to communicate with Spotify and pull user Data and analytics to display on our app. This data will be stored on our app using the React-Redux library.
